## Introduction
oxDNA is a molecular dynamics simulation code that can be used to study the mechanical and thermodynamic properties of DNA and RNA molecules. Umbrella sampling is a highly parallelizable simulation technique that is used to calculate the free energy profiles between two particles or groups of particles. The `ipy_oxDNA` repository provides a Python interface for running oxDNA umbrella sampling simulations, allowing users to easily perform these simulations and analyze their results.

## How to run NVIDIA Multiprocessing Service (mps)
NVIDIA MPS is a specialized service offered by NVIDIA, designed to enhance the multiprocessing capabilities of CUDA-enabled GPUs. Utilizing MPS allows for the execution of multiple simulations on a single GPU, resulting in an approximate **2.5x performance increase** for specific simulation techniques such as *Umbrella Sampling, Metadynamics, and Multi-Replica simulations*.

In the absence of MPS, running concurrent simulations on a single GPU can lead to significant performance degradation. For comprehensive details on MPS, the official documentation is available at [NVIDIA MPS Documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/mps/index.html).

```bash
export CUDA_MPS_PIPE_DIRECTORY=/tmp/mps-pipe_$SLURM_TASK_PID
export CUDA_MPS_LOG_DIRECTORY=/tmp/mps-log_$SLURM_TASK_PID
mkdir -p $CUDA_MPS_PIPE_DIRECTORY
mkdir -p $CUDA_MPS_LOG_DIRECTORY
nvidia-cuda-mps-control -d
```

## Prerequisites
